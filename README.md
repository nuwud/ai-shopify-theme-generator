# AI-Assisted Shopify Theme Development

This project provides tools and resources for creating Shopify themes with AI assistance. It demonstrates how large language models like Claude can help streamline the Shopify theme development process.

## What's Included

1. **ShopifyAI-SuperPrompt.md** - A specially crafted prompt template for AI assistants to help generate Shopify theme code.

2. **create-shopify-theme.sh** - A CLI script that automates the creation of a Shopify theme with all necessary files and directories.

3. **Example Theme Structure** - A complete Shopify theme structure with modern, responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

## Why Use AI for Shopify Theme Development?

Developing Shopify themes traditionally requires expertise in Liquid templating, CSS, JavaScript, and e-commerce design patterns. AI assistance can:

- **Accelerate Development**: Generate boilerplate code and common components quickly
- **Reduce Errors**: Ensure proper Shopify theme structure and valid schema settings
- **Enable Non-Experts**: Allow those with limited Liquid knowledge to create professional themes
- **Explore Design Options**: Quickly iterate through different design approaches and components
- **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure consistent styling and behavior across the theme

## Getting Started

### Using the CLI Script

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed
2. Install the Shopify CLI: `npm install -g @shopify/cli @shopify/theme`
3. Run the script: `./create-shopify-theme.sh`
4. Follow the prompts to configure your theme
5. Deploy to Shopify:
   ```
   cd your-theme-directory
   shopify theme push --store=your-store.myshopify.com
   ```

### Using AI Assistance

1. Copy the content from ShopifyAI-SuperPrompt.md
2. Paste it into a conversation with Claude or another AI assistant
3. Fill in the details specific to your store needs
4. The AI will generate code for a complete Shopify theme

## Theme Structure

The generated theme follows Shopify's recommended structure:

```
theme/
├── assets/             # CSS, JavaScript, and other static assets
├── config/             # Theme settings
├── layout/             # Theme layouts (theme.liquid)
├── locales/            # Translations
├── sections/           # Reusable content sections
├── snippets/           # Reusable code snippets
└── templates/          # Page templates
```

## Features

The AI-generated theme includes:

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout with proper breakpoints
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Modern utility-first CSS framework
- **Accessibility Features**: Semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and skip links
- **Performance Optimizations**: Lazy loading, proper image handling
- **E-commerce Best Practices**: Cart functionality, product displays, etc.

## Customizing Your Theme

After generating the base theme, you can:

1. Edit section schemas to add more customization options
2. Modify the CSS in `assets/theme.css` to match your brand
3. Add additional templates for different page types
4. Create custom snippets for reusable components
5. Extend the JavaScript functionality in `assets/theme.js`

## Best Practices

When working with AI-generated Shopify themes:

1. **Always validate** the generated code before deploying
2. **Test thoroughly** on different devices and browsers
3. **Optimize images** and assets for performance
4. **Follow Shopify's guidelines** for theme development
5. **Keep theme settings** well-organized and documented
